An online map where people can post their current mood and see the average mood from other locations.

### AI Usage
This project was primarily created using human intelligence, but artificial intelligence contributed in a few areas: correcting English grammar in some texts and assisting with client-side development, mainly by helping me write Google queries for topics I was unfamiliar with. (HackClub required disclosure of any AI assistance, so it was only right to include this section.) Also, AI generates commit messages for me sometimes.
